# CRAPS 
The most popular game of chance in casinos is the dice game known as "Craps", which consists of placing different bets on the result found by rolling two dice in the next roll or in an entire round.

## HOW TO PLAY?
A player rolls 2 dice with 6 faces each and the faces contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 points. Once the dice have stopped, the sum of the points on the two upper faces is calculated to establish whether it has been won or lost according to the following:

### There are two ways to win:
- Obtaining a score of 7 or 11 on the first throw.
- Obtaining a score of 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 in the first thrown, then said sum becomes the "point" or the "Compulsory shot", and the player must continue rolling the dice to achieve the same "point" again, before getting a 7 on a later roll.

### There are also two ways to lose:
- Roll the dice once and get 2, 3 or 12 (known as "Craps"), that is, the house "wins".
- Roll 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 on the first throw and roll a 7 on the subsequent throw before repeating the original “point”.
