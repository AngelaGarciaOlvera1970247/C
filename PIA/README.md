# CRAPS 

### HOW TO PLAY?
A player rolls 2 dice with 6 faces each and the faces contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 points. Once the dice have stopped, the sum of the points on the two upper faces is calculated to establish whether it has been won or lost according to the following:
There are two ways to win:
a)	Obtaining a score of 7 or 11 on the first throw.
b)	Obtaining a score of 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 in the first thrown, then said sum becomes the "point" or the "Compulsory shot", and the player must continue rolling the dice to achieve the same "point" again, before getting a 7 on a later roll.
There are also two ways to lose:
a)	Roll the dice once and get 2, 3 or 12 (known as "Craps"), that is, the house "wins".
b)	Roll 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 on the first throw and roll a 7 on the subsequent throw before repeating the original “point”.
